As a Licensed Professional Counselor and Life Coach that is my job to impact individuals and help clients work through emotional difficulties and reach goals. But I will be honest with you I was selling the dream but not always living the dream. I had issues I had not worked completely through like childhood trauma, heartbreak, disappointments, and frustrations with life. Don't get me wrong I had the husband, the kids, the house and the 6 figure job but I was not happy inside, but I didn't change because I hate change, most of us hate change, right? Then I lost my sister, my friend, and it slapped me in the face that I need to take care of myself. I saw the addiction, I saw her not taking care of herself and I could not save her. One thing I know for sure, if you do not make your wellness a priority illness will find you. I remember the moment we lost her, the earth stood still and then my heart broke into pieces, what was I going to do, I have loved her my whole life! It was months later that I made a decision that I would be the change I hope to see, I would create a space for women of color to move past the obstacles that keep us from creating the life we want and Brown Suga Wellness was born.

        "Here is the final part. Part 3\n---\n\nHere we will be showing how the principles and practices we\u2019ve covered so far converge into one over-arching result that will benefit you for the rest of your life. You can think of it as flipping a switch that changes how you create new results in life one day at a time. This is at the very core of what we call Day Sculpting. \nThe simplest way to think of it is that most of the way we live is habitual. You have an habitual way of brushing your teeth, walking, talking to yourself and others, eating, working. Habits are wonderful\u2026they make life easy but they also limit you. For example, if you have a habit of eating too much, you\u2019ll put on weight. Not instantly, but steadily, day by day, until one day you have a weight problem. If you try to change your weight quickly through a trendy new diet, research shows that the weight is likely to come back, and then some, within a few short months, because the habits required to live at your ideal weight have not been properly established. \nHabits are habits because you don\u2019t think about them, they happen nonconsciously. If you want a change in your life, you have to embody the change at a nonconscious level, so that the habits keeping your life the way it is today begin to shift.\nWouldn\u2019t it be great if there was a switch in the brain that would move you from status quo to status GO!? This is a switch that once you flip it will produce the result you want, if you are willing to commit to and stay with the process.Day Sculpting is your guide to fully realizing the success you are ready to enjoy.\nA critically important capacity of the human mind called preconscious processing. This is the ability of the mind to receive information, beneath our conscious awareness, and act upon it without even knowing that it is happening. Used correctly, this is an amazing power. Used improperly, it will sabotage your best efforts and make life extremely difficult.\nMost of us think we are running the show with our conscious awareness, consciously choosing our thoughts, behaviors, and emotions and consequently, we believe are able to choose the results we create in life. However, what neuro-science research shows, is that we all have a vast nonconscious mind that is really running the show most of the time. That deeper part of us, in charge of our habitual thinking, feeling, and behaving is always operating in our best interest. But it does so using information that may be faulty or outdated. If you continue to feed it information that doesn\u2019t serve you, it will continue to habitually bring results that are less than desired.\nYour preconscious processor is constantly routing new information directly into this larger database that your mind uses to create new behaviors. Your job is to place the right information into this database every single day, so that it can draw upon this new data and create new results. It requires your vigilance and purposeful intention on a daily basis. Day Sculpting is the process to accomplish exactly that, getting you to focus one day at a time on what you are trying to create in your life today, and the future you truly desire. \nA lot of experts in the human development field teach information and then expect it will translate into new behaviors automatically. But as we\u2019ve pointed out, and as you\u2019ve probably experienced, consciously knowing something and having the nonconscious mind put it into a new behavior, are two entirely different processes. What we are sharing with you is how to bridge that gap. This is precisely why so many experts in the field are recommending Day Sculpting to their clients, to help them use momentum mindsets on a daily basis and apply the good information they teach. \nWe talk about The The Solutions Focus process . Try it out: \nThink of an area of your life in which you are actively attempting to create different results. Imagine your chief aim regarding this area of your life as a perfect future. Now imagine a scale from one to ten, where ten is the perfect future and one is that you have not even started thinking about your chief aim. On this imaginary scale from 1 to 10, where would you place yourself right now?\nGo ahead and imagine where would you place yourself right now on that scale, where ten is your perfect future.\nWhatever number you came up with is fine. Whether it was 3 or 7, whatever you came up with I\u2019ll always ask the same next question. \u201cWhy so high and not lower?\u201d\nLet\u2019s say, for example that you came up with a three. Asking the question \u201cWhy so High\u201d catches the mind off guard. Most people expect, \u201cOnly a 3! Why so low?\u201d If I had asked that what would you come up with? All the reasons why things aren\u2019t working, who is to blame, problems, excuses, lack, limitations, and so on. \nBut when I ask \u201cWhy so high?\u201d the brain immediately begins to sort for all of the things that are working for you, everything that has brought you up to a \u201cthree.\u201d If you said you are at a seven on a scale of one to ten, the same question applies: \u201cWhy so high and not lower?\u201d\nThe next step in solutions focus is equally powerful. \u201cThink about what you can do today to move you one point up that scale\u2014for example, from a three to a four, or from a seven to an eight?\u201d When you ask this, your mind instantaneously starts generating ideas and options to answer your question. You quickly realize you can do more of the things that work, right? And if you are doing things that aren\u2019t working, you now have the insight into how you can do things differently. \nThis solutions focus approach provides quick insight into how to move things forward in areas you may have been stuck or working on unsuccessfully. It is a brilliant way to access more of your nonconscious database and facilitate discovering resources you did not know were there. \nSo as you can see, this video has been centered on connecting the dots and providing you with the insights on how you can flip the switch in your brain and how you can create your life one day at a time in the most powerful way possible. \nYou must contact that inner part of you that is in charge of your habitual ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving in order to re-sculpt yourself.\nThis is a unique psychological principle called anchoring. In the research this is also called behavioral conditioning, and as we\u2019ve called it, the law of reinforcement\u2026which says you get more of what you reinforce. When you want to reinforce a positive new behavior, you anchor it in a positive new momentum mindset. As you do this on a daily basis, you are literally training your mind, conditioning your thoughts, amplifying positive feelings and emotions to live into a future state that you are anchoring in your daily experience. \nDay Sculpting goes beyond personal development. It takes whatever it is you are currently learning and makes it possible for you to embody, apply and enjoy the benefits you are committed to achieve. \n\nThe last thing anyone needs is more stuff to do. What we need is that everything we do gets us the results we are going for. In essence what\u2019s needed is a system that will streamline our efforts so we accomplish our chief aims in less time.\n\nMichaelangelo said the process of sculpting is to remove what\u2019s not supposed to be there. He had the mindset that the finished sculpture already existed in the marble and he just had to reveal it. In the same way your destiny already resides in you. You just need to clear a path for it to emerge.\n\nWe all have 24 hours in a day. So why do some people consistently have great days while others are up and down and stay stuck in mediocrity? It\u2019s a disciplined habit of how you approach everyday. Day Sculpting takes the same 24 hours that we all have and helps clarify your choices so that your actions reveal your highest destiny. \n\nIt is a quick, easy and effortless way that supports and empowers your efforts in achieving your chief aims. It creates the mindsets necessary to have successful days, weeks, months and years.\n\nDay Sculpting is a 90- day program designed to empower you to create your life ONE DAY AT A TIME. By committing 30 minutes each day to create what you want that day. \n\nWe believe that when you focus your actions one day at a time the results you get become measurable and achievable. Your energy is committed to channeling your efforts so you create a confident groove in your mind that empowers your habitual actions to create what you really want.\n\nThis daily program is broken down into 3 MANAGEABLE, SIMPLE AND EASY STEPS. 15 minutes in the morning, 5 minutes midday and 10 minutes at night. \n\nDay Sculpting\u2026It\u2019s designed so that the way you start your day creates the momentum that carries you throughout your day. \n\nAnd finally research has shown that the best time to integrate what you\u2019ve learned in your day and to set yourself up for success tomorrow is before you go to sleep. The Nighttime Review process takes just 10 minutes, which is less time then it takes to take a shower or to take your dog on an evening walk.\n\nWe already have enough complexity in life\u2026don\u2019t we? We don\u2019t want you working harder we want you thinking smarter! So that the success you achieve is more effortless. \n\nSo what does it take for someone to accomplish the high level results we are talking about?\n\n\u2022 First you have to wake up and be totally jazzed about the day\n\u2022 You have to be inspired to do your best\n\u2022 You have to be focused on creating what you truly desire\n\u2022 You got to get to it, stay on it, and be in the energy of it before your distractions take over. \n\u2022 And if distractions takeover you have to quickly get back on track.\n\u2022 You have to learn from what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not\n\u2022 You have to be able to listen to feedback and course correct during your day\n\u2022 And at the end of the day you have be able to feel you did your best and you can do even better tomorrow\n\nAnd with Day Sculpting you can accomplish this and more in less than 30 minutes which is distributed throughout your day. Most people will give up on their dreams after they have tried something only 3 times because they didn\u2019t get instant gratification. \n\nThere are no magic bullets here. You are investing in a future YOU desire. \n\nDay Sculpting gives you the opportunity everyday to purposefully stay in the energy of what you want to create the benefit to you being a more empowered mindset that inspires passionate action and a willingness to breakthrough any barriers that may have held you back in the past so you fully embody the life you choose to live.\n\nYou may have heard Gandhi say \u201cBe the change you want to see in the world.\u201d Well now you can. \n\nYears ago I heard a statistic that blew me away. If you read in a single subject of your choice for 15 minutes a day 5 days a week you would become one of the leading experts in the world in that subject within 3 years\u2026\n\nMore recent research has demonstrated that world class talent requires 10000 hours and 10 years to develop\u2026\n\nSo the question is how does somebody create this kind of commitment and persistence? Clearly one day at a time.\n\nSo where are you not following through in your life? How would you like to do things differently? What can you do shift your energy when you say I can\u2019t get it done or you procrastinate? What\u2019s it going to take for you to say I\u2019ve had enough it\u2019s time for me to do something different? Where will you get the support you need to build the confidence to stay on track?\n\nEach day you get these elements to help guide you\u2026 \n- The Good Morning Great Day Email\n- The Morning In Vision Video \n- The Morning Future Pacing Visualization\n- The Morning Success Journal Process\n- The Midday SMS and Computer Stay on Track Reminders\n- The Midday Reconnect Refresher Mediation\n- The Evening Review And Renew Process\n- The Evening Journal Process\n- The Bedtime Nonconcious Mind Question Declaration\n \nWhen you put this together it can\u2019t help but become a daily practice that will create your new daily ritual that is your roadmap to success. We are giving you the daily steps that will create your momentum mindsets.\n\nThe Day Sculpting program leaves you no wiggle room. The days of \u201cI\u2019ll get to it later\u201d are gone. When you are serious about changing your life, you now have a realistic opportunity to do so with this program. \n\nWE invite you to fully commit to your life.

        "Paper Name: My Tweets Bring All the Traits to the Yard: Predicting Personality and Relational Traits in Online Social Networks\n\nAbstract: Users in Online Social Networks (OSNs,) leave traces that reflect their personality characteristics. The study of these traces is important for several fields, such as social science, psychology, marketing, and others. Despite a marked increase in research on personality prediction based on online behavior, the focus has been heavily on individual personality traits, and by doing so, largely neglects relational facets of personality. This study aims to address this gap by providing a prediction model for holistic personality profiling in OSNs that includes socio-relational traits (attachment orientations) in combination with standard personality traits. Specifically, we first designed a feature engineering methodology that extracts a wide range of features (accounting for behavior, language, and emotions) from the OSN accounts of users. Subsequently, we designed a machine learning model that predicts trait scores of users based on the extracted features. The proposed model architecture is inspired by characteristics embedded in psychology; i.e, it utilizes interrelations among personality facets and leads to increased accuracy in comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches. To demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, we applied our model on two datasets, namely regular OSN users and opinion leaders on social media, and contrast both samples\u2019 psychological profiles. Our findings demonstrate that the two groups can be clearly separated by focusing on both Big Five personality traits and attachment orientations. The presented research provides a promising avenue for future research on OSN user characterization and classification.\n\nIntroduction: Online Social Networks (OSNs) offer a virtual space in which people connect and interact with others, express themselves, and receive information, in a continuous digital reflection of the real (offline) world. In OSNs, people typically showcase their real self [40] and leave traces in online behavior, which reflect their real-world personality [24]. These traces expose a holistic image of oneself, including both personal characteristics (personality traits) and characteristics that portray their behavior in relation to others (relational traits).\n\nThe term personality refers to characteristic combinations or patterns of behaviors, cognitions, and emotional reactions that evolve from biological and environmental factors and form relatively consistent individual differences [13]. The Big Five (BF) or Five Factor model [29] is one of the most distinctive personality theories that constitutes five main traits of human personality representing individual differences in cognition, emotion, and behavior: Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. On the other hand, relational traits have also been linked with consistencies in social behavior and interaction patterns, with attachment theory [7] as the most emblematic theoretical framework in that respect [31, 43], capturing how individuals experience close relationships to and interactions with others.\n\nPersonality traits have been studied in the context of OSNs and the web overall, as findings show that they are strongly linked to OSN use [57], online friendships [60], and online reviews [52]. Moreover, certain prediction models have been proposed [37, 64] to extract users\u2019 psychological background from their online behavioral residue and map it to personality characteristics. However, relational traits such as attachment orientations (AO) have been overlooked in online environments, even though user activity in OSNs heavily relates to social behavior characteristics. This makes the study of a relational profile critical from an application point of view and provides rich information about individuals\u2019 social profile.\n\nThe present research aims to address this limitation in OSN research, by studying and predicting both relational traits and personality traits of users. The importance of relational facets of personality for explaining social interaction cannot be overstated. Given that online social media engagement resembles actual social interactions in many respects [15, 30], the need to study how different personality facets are reflected in online expression is particularly compelling. Attachment orientations, a key individual difference of relational orientation, can be derived on the basis of traces found in micro-blogs. Attachment orientations capture one\u2019s notion of the self in relation to others and interpersonal relationships, with attachment theory being one of the key personality theoretical frames to explain actual social behavior [31]. Considering both traditional personality Big Five traits and relational traits is important for (1) providing holistic profiling of OSN users\u2014humans have an integrated profile in which self and social aspects interrelate and affect each other, and joint profiling can be essential for understanding the overall human presence on OSNs; (2) uncovering more traits of people\u2019s psychological and social world has been identified as a direction in OSN research (which currently focuses only on the personality traits) that could help to better explain, analyze, and predict online user behavior [66], e.g., with applications on customer segmentation [46] or digital advertisement environments [17]; and (3) shedding light on social interaction phenomena taking place in OSNs is of great socioeconomic importance, e.g., community formation [32], decision making [42], or information diffusion [12].\n\nTo this end, the present article proposes a novel data-driven approach to predict a holistic psychological profile of OSN users, capturing both their personality and relational traits.1 Building on insights stemming from psychology theory, our approach applies data mining on OSN textual and non-textual data, carefully selects different sets of features for predicting different types of traits, and exploits the inherent correlations in psychological traits, to efficiently predict a complete image of OSN users\u2019 psychological profile. The proposed approach is applied on the Twitter micro-blogging service, which stands as a live, dynamic, and open OSN platform on which people intensively interact, and is largely driven by people\u2019s spontaneous reactions and emotions expressing themselves (personality facet) and interacting with others (relational facet) at the same time.\n\nSpecifically, our contributions in detail are as follows:\n\nData mining and feature engineering for psychology traces in OSN. Motivated by psychology theory on personality suggesting that traits are reflected in different types of online behavior and actions, we identify a large set of features that capture language, behavioral, and emotional expressions of users in OSNs. The proposed feature engineering methodology accounts for a larger set of features than those considered in previous works, thus allowing to target more generic psychological profiling. To apply and test our methodology, we collected a labeled dataset: through a crowdsourcing platform, we recruited 243 individuals who consented to provide information about their psychology profiles. Subsequently, we compiled a ground-truth dataset labeled with their psychology profiles. We used the Twitter API to collect 350,000 tweets from the Twitter accounts of recruited participants and applied the proposed feature engineering methodology.\n\nHolistic psychological profiling. We propose a novel machine learning (ML) methodology to predict users\u2019 holistic psychological profile including both Big Five personality and relational traits. The novelty of the proposed methodology is that it (1) uses a large set of the collected (psychological-related) features, (2) carefully selects the subsets of them with the strongest predictive power for each trait, and (3) exploits correlations between personality and relational (i.e., social) behavior traits to enhance individual trait predictions. In this way, our approach not only predicts social facets of a psychology profile (which is not captured by existing personality prediction models) along with personality facets but also leverages the different traits for more accurate holistic profile prediction.\n\nNew insights and improvement of prediction accuracy. Evaluating our methodology reveals interesting insights for the prediction of psychology traits from OSN traces: (1) using different sets of features performs better in predicting different psychological traits, (2) relational traits can be predicted as efficiently as personality traits, and (3) holistic personality prediction outperforms individual trait predicting models. We believe that our findings can pave the ground for future experimentation and studies in psychology profiling in OSNs. Moreover, the accuracy achieved by our approach (across all traits) is higher than current state-of-the-art approaches, which currently are limited to Big Five personality traits instead of relational traits. For example, applying the approach of [12] to our data provides a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.284, while our prediction model achieves a 29% improvement for personality traits (RMSE = 0.203) and has 32% better average performance when accounting for all traits (0.192 RMSE); this improvement comes as a result of using both a psychology-driven feature engineering methodology and a holistic profiling approach.\n\nPsychological profiling in the wild. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed psychological profiling methodology through a use case. We identify a set of Twitter users who seem to be accepted as opinion leaders on social media (i.e., have a large following). We apply our methodology to predict their psychological profiles and analyze results. We find that the distributions of traits significantly deviates from regular users (defined as users included in our ground-truth dataset), and that the set of leaders can be clearly separated by only using their psychological profiles. These findings highlight the usefulness of our approach in the characterization of the personalities for different groups of OSN users (e.g., such a group psychological profile could be used to recommend skills/activities/jobs to users based on their profile similarity) and classification of users based on their profiles.\n\nIn this section, we provide an overview of related psychological literature, discuss related work, and highlight several open issues of existing methods. We also highlight the contribution of the present work. Section 3 details the collected dataset and the data mining and feature engineering methodology, and Section 4 presents the design and evaluation of the proposed machine learning predictive model. Finally, we conclude our article and discuss future work in Section 6.\n\nFirst, Please Summarize the paper in 10 points, in easy to read and understand simple English.\nSecond, Explain what the paper does as if I'm 11 years old.\n\nThanks :))",

        "Here is Text 2: Communicating with External Audiences\n\nMany managers believe that they will never have to deal with the press. Often,\nthey regard it with hostility. Most think press relations are entirely the domain\nof their company\u2019s or agency\u2019s public relations department. But in fact, senior\nexecutives say they spend more time on communications than on other tasks,\nand a significant component of that time is devoted to press and public relations.\nJunior managers need to be highly sensitive to press relations for the following\nreasons:\n\u2022 Often, free press can be the best way to acquaint the public with your product or service.\nTo cite only one example, the amount Microsoft spent on advertising Windows\n95 was dwarfed by the value of the free publicity it received from\ninternational news coverage.\n\u2022 Your particular area of expertise may unexpectedly become something your organization\nneeds to promote or explain. Line workers at auto companies have been drafted\nto extol quality improvements in advertisements; accountants may be called\nto the CEO\u2019s office for briefings on a potentially embarrassing news report or\nan upcoming press conference.\n\u2022 Public relations considerations need to be addressed at the beginning, not the end, of a\nplanning process. Business history is replete with examples of companies that\ninvested vast sums to develop products, ideas, or services that couldn\u2019t be sold\nbecause of public resistance to the concept, the configuration, or the public\nimage of the company. General Motors\u2019 Tacos, for example, could be the best\nin the world and still not jump off the shelves.\n\u2022 Junior managers become senior managers who will eventually have to deal with the\npress directly. As both marketers and corporate citizens, organizations have to\nexplain themselves to the public constantly through advertising, press releases,\nand press conferences. Junior managers who understand this aspect of their\nwork are likely to become senior managers faster. 1. A successful manager understands how the press works. Successful managers\ntend to follow the press in general, and how their organization is playing in particular.\nMembers of the press tend to trust companies and individuals with a\ntrack record of accuracy and accessibility. To cite only two examples, both\nJohnson & Johnson and Perrier survived charges of contaminated products because\nthey had a record of reliability and accessibility and addressed the problems\nimmediately. In both cases, and many others, stonewalling would have\nbeen disastrous to the company\u2019s image of wholesomeness and purity. Most\npress stories last only a few days, but they can leave an indelible impression in\nthe public\u2019s mind. Many managers tend to believe they can \u201csnow\u201d the press\nwith their greater expertise, but this strategy rarely works. Most reporters are\nhard-working professionals who will carefully check out an expert assertion or\nwho know someone who can.\n2. A successful manager understands what the press needs. What the press needs\nis a story, and bad news generally sells better than good news. Companies and\nindividuals are most likely to have to deal with the press when something has\ngone wrong. This suggests a couple of lessons. When you have good stories,\ngive them to the press to establish a record of credibility; many media outlets\nwill print or broadcast a press release from a reliable source more or less verbatim.\nConsider how private decisions may look if they should become public.\nIf something has gone wrong, take the initiative in announcing it, explaining it,\nand telling the world how it\u2019s going to be corrected.\n3. A successful manager understands press jargon. Reputable reporters will\nstick to their verbal agreements on how information you provide them is to\nbe used. How you will be quoted depends on the ground rules you establish\nat the beginning of an interview. Deep background means the reporter can\nreflect the information in her story without possible attribution. Background\nmeans that you can be referenced as \u201ca reliable source.\u201d Any other comment,\nhowever apparently casual or social, can be quoted directly and\nattributed.\n4. A successful manager should be able to generate an attention-grabbing, accurate,\nand well-constructed press release. While many managers may not be\nregularly mailing out press releases themselves, most will be contributing to\nthem and need to understand how they work. A good press release is extremely\nformulaic and follows the structure of a good news story:\na. The first paragraph states the main point clearly and emphasizes its newsworthiness.\nFor example: \u201cAcme Corporation announced today that it is\nreleasing the best tire ever available on the world market.\u201d\nb. The second paragraph provides a quote from a reputable source: \u201cAcme\nPresident Rudy Roadrunner said, \u2018Not only does this tire surpass all our\ncompetitors\u2019 in endurance, quality, and safety; it\u2019s also available at a lower\nprice.\u2019 \u201d\nc. The third paragraph provides evidence that the claims made so far are true:\n\u201cIn repeated tests against our competitors . . . \u201d\nd. The remaining paragraphs provide background information on the product, the\ncompany, and Rudy Roadrunner, and they demonstrate a track record of credibility.\nThey may also include testimonials available from respected independent\nsources. Obviously, the formula of an effective press release will vary depending on\nthe nature of the news to be announced. But the pyramid structure suggested by\nthis example always applies: Move from the most important and specific to the\nleast important and most general information. Busy editors often run a press release\nmore or less verbatim and just cut it off when they run out of space. The\neasier you make their jobs, the more likely they are to cover your story.\nOnce you\u2019ve written or contributed to a press release, decide who\u2019s most\nlikely to run it. This can cover the gamut from extremely specialized trade magazines\nto the national or international media. Consider the use of venues other\nthan print and broadcast media as well; perhaps there\u2019s a room on the Internet\nwhere interested parties are likely to gather.\n5. A successful manager understands the role of the press in crisis management.\nThis includes knowing how to provide effective interviews and\nunderstanding when and how to hold a press conference. Certain rules\napply to both:\n\nApplications\na. Identify your central message, make sure you can back it up, and stick to it.\nb. Prepare materials in advance\u2014press releases, statements, supportive\nstudies\u2014that the reporters can take away with them and study or quote later.\nc. Never say more than you know to be true. If you don\u2019t know, say, \u201cI don\u2019t\nhave that information at the moment, but I\u2019ll get it to you as soon as I do\u201d\u2014\nthen follow up.\nd. Make sure your team is behind you. This means making sure not only that\ntop management of a corporation agrees on a message, but also that other\npotential press sources (for example, subordinate employees) have the same\ninformation you\u2019re dispensing to the public, believe it, and are unlikely to\nleak contradictory and embarrassing information.\ne. Provide the press with the most credible and informed access possible. Reporters\nwill always want to get to the top. They\u2019ll be more likely to cover\nthe comments of a CEO or a Cabinet secretary than those of a press agent\nor an underling. But they will understand that a high official may need to\nrefer technical questions to an informed specialist.\nf. Anticipate, and be prepared to respond to, the most difficult questions.\ng. Don\u2019t become hostile or defensive; experienced reporters are experts at\nsmelling anxiety.\nh. Make your answers brief, quotable, and to the point. Rambling and repetition\nare likely to get you into trouble or open new lines of inquiry.\ni. If you\u2019re facing a problem you\u2019ve caused, however inadvertently, be prepared\nto acknowledge\n\nAre you ready for text 3?",
        "Here is Text 3: Diversity and Intercultural Communication \n\nGenerally, the best answer to these questions is yes, but it always depends on the personal as well as the business aspects of your relationship. One good rule of thumb: When the other person gives\nyou an opening, pursue it, and build on your mutual experience.\nThis issue comes up even more in international communication. As companies\nfrom manufacturers to media conglomerates become increasingly global, managers\nneed to understand the norms of other cultures. Although English is on the verge of\nbecoming the international language, standards of behavior and social interaction\nvary greatly between the United States and England, let alone between, say, France\nand Japan. In one country an invitation to dinner may be considered an expected\npoliteness, while in another, it may be an invasion of a colleague\u2019s private time.\nAsking about someone\u2019s family may be absolutely required in one culture and offensively\nintrusive in another.\nNo textbook can cover all such contingencies; one good rule if you\u2019re not sure\nmay be the trial lawyer\u2019s: Don\u2019t ask a question to which you don\u2019t already know the\nanswer. Another, and sometimes contradictory, rule is: Be frank about your cultural\nconfusion. Your colleague likely will have been in the same situation himself and\nwill be happy to help out. Finally, do your research; you\u2019re likely to have a friend or\ncoworker who knows the terrain better than you do. Our purpose here is to sensitize\nmanagers to their increasing need to understand the norms of cultures other than\ntheir own. (For a case addressing the special features of international communication,\nsee International Oil later in this chapter.)\nThe opportunities for cultural confusion\u2014personal, commercial, ethical, and\nlinguistic\u2014are almost endless. Imagine marketing a Chevy Nova in Hispanic countries,\nwhere \u201cno va\u201d means \u201cit doesn\u2019t run.\u201d Many products that are perfectly safe to\nmarket in first-world countries raise ethical problems when sold in developing\ncountries\u2014infant baby formula, for example, which if mixed with contaminated\nwater can cause death. Working in other cultures means understanding your hosts\u2019\nconceptions of greetings, timing, hygiene, negotiation, agreement, politeness, personal\nspace, gesture, meal etiquette, and closure.\nWhile English has essentially become the international language, it\u2019s important\nto remember that there are many Englishes. A joke in one form of English can be a\ndeadly insult in another. Although it may seem too obvious to emphasize, you must\nunderstand the cultural norms and language use of people from other cultures before\nyou can communicate effectively with them. This is true even if they are, say,\nthe South American employees of your Canadian company. A bribe in one culture\ncan be a thoughtful gift in another.\nA recent article by Sydel Sokuvitz (Business Communication Quarterly, New\nYork, March, 2002) suggests some principles for conducting successful intercultural\nbusiness communication. Sokuvitz first describes the special challenges global\nmanagers face, including:\nCoping with a range of tensions that arise out of internationally dispersed activities,\nThe challenges of maintaining coordinated activities across time-zones, cultural\nboundaries, and different countries\u2019 laws, and\nThe difficulties posed when the right medium for your message in one culture\nmay be wrong in another.\nDrawing on a range of research in the field, Sokuvitz comes up with several\nprovocative conclusions:\nExcessive dependence on technological communication such as E-mail can result\nin problems for both communication and productivity.\nFace-to-face meetings with colleagues from other cultures are critical to achieving\neffective communication.\nStudying with students from other cultures is critical to preparing a manager\nfor working in the increasingly globalized economy.\nSokuvitz cites the following example from an article by Fernandez-Aroaz\n(\u201cHiring without Firing,\u201d Harvard Business Review, 1999):\nA U.S.-based telecommunications company was seeking a CEO for its new division\nin Latin America. An international search was conducted, and a veteran was\nhired, someone known as an effective manager and marketing expert. \u201cBut his run\nlasted less than a year and was nothing short of a disaster. The simple reason was\nthat he lacked the two skills that the job really required: negotiation and cross-cultural\nsensitivity.\u201d\nEventually the company was saved from near-bankruptcy by bringing in a\nnew CEO who was a native Latin American with work experience in the U.S. His\nability to bridge cultural differences is credited with saving the company.\nCommunications between headquarters and subsidiaries is only one example\nof the challenges posed by globalization. Companies in one country are under increasing\nsocial pressure to take responsibility for the behavior of their subcontractors\nin other countries. Recently, for example, Nike suffered adverse publicity because\nof the work practices of shoe manufacturers it employs in Asia.\nThe successful manager of the future increasingly will be required to be a citizen\nof the world. While electronic communication may work fine for conveying information\nor directions, there is no substitute for \u201cspeaking the language\u201d of the\npeople with whom you\u2019re trying to communicate.\n\nAre you ready to answer some questions on text 1, text 2 and text 3?",

Moreover, the project adopts a co-design approach and convenes a Knowledge User Panel. The panel will be involved in all phases of the competency framework development as they will review findings from the scoping review and focus groups. \n\nFocus group with mental health clinicians \n Mental health clinicians (i.e., psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, youth outreach workers and nurse practitioners) will be invited to join focus groups to review youth narratives and discuss how they would address the needs of the Black youth involved. The youth narratives will be generated through collecting stories from social media and through an online survey. The survey will ask about young people's experiences with mental health conditions, their use of mental health services, and their suggestions for how to improve mental health care for young people. The online survey will collect stories anonymously. Anyone who submits a story through the survey will be redirected to a list of resources. The focus groups will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by thematic analysis. The focus groups will continue until thematic saturation.\n\nPhase 3: Persona Scenario method with Black youth\n Black youth will be invited to focus groups (or one-on-one interviews, if requested) using persona scenario methods. The findings from the focus groups with mental health clinicians will be used to create clinician personas, including information about their motivations, challenges and describe the different ways in which the clinician might interact with the Black youth based on youth narratives. Black youth will be asked to share their perspectives and preferred clinician responses. The focus groups will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. We will continue to hold focus groups until thematic saturation.\n\nCan you with the information above, create a sceenario/dialogue where a black youth, aged 15 living in Ontario suffering from racism from his classmates and is going to seek the help of a mental health professional who uses the information to engage the youth \n\nlimit prose to 500 characters",
