        "content": "The image showcases the Statue of Liberty, a colossal bronze statue located in New York Harbor, a heritage building in the United States. The statue has a majestic presence, with one arm raised towards the sun and the other hitched on her hip. It sits atop a keeper's walkway, observed from the water. Surrounding the statue is a lush green meadow, where picnic spots, walkways, and a visitor desk can be found. In front of the statue, a large marina can accommodate fourteen different kinds of boats. In the backdrop stands the Empire State Building, marking the crowded skyscrapers of New York City.",
