Generic interface to various configurations of the Perceiver Resampler, that simply takes in a series of (potentially
time-indexed) contextual embeddings, and "resamples" (compresses) them down to a pre-specified number of latents! Note
that the Perceiver in general resamples based solely off the *long-range* context; there's a nice opportunity here to
prime the Perceiver Resampler with say a single layer's worth of language embeddings (the target domain), and use that
to softly "retrieve & compress" what we need --> this would be a novel contribution we should explore.
